# About Me
Hi there! My name is Mohan, and I am currently a senior at the University of Virginia. <br/> <br/>
🔭 I'm currently working on code to model effusion out of a quantum mechanical particle in a box. This is done by creating the box then applying flux-flux and flux-side correlation functions. I'm also exploring a generalization of the Gaussian-Core interaction potential called GEM-n using LAMMPS. <br/> <br/>
🌱 I'm currently learning about probability distribution functions, math for machine learning, and the programming language, Julia. <br/> <br/>
💬 Ask me about my love for the Fourier transform or my thoughts on pedagogy and communication practices.
